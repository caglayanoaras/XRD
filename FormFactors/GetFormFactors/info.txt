1. edist_atom files are 3d numpy arrays of electron density of single atoms. Numbers in the name show the center coordination of the atom.

2. You can produce edist atoms from the CHGFileAnalysis folder.

3. Three notebooks are for 3 different atoms (Ti,Al,N)

4. There is only one atom for each atom type because all of them are similar. (All N atoms have similar atomic form factors for instance. )

5. There are two form factors for each atom. One is in 100 and other is in 111 direction. They are similar though. spherical symmetry is somewhat accurate.

6. Python script is used for plotting atomic form factors. It also produces a json file where the coefficients of the analytic fit is kept. (Just like ICT coefficients)
